Remove and reset cluster database, files, and solr indexes and apply seed data

THIS IS DESTRUCTIVE. USE ONLY WHEN CERTAIN.

This:

* Zeros out the files, database tables, and solr indexes on a cluster,
* Loads seed data from the cluster seed, and
* Ensures matterhorn is running.

This is most useful to allow you to restore a matterhorn cluster to a
consistent state based on the seed file you're applying.
