Publish a cluster seed file to s3

This takes the cluster seed file generated by `cluster:create_seed_file` and
publishes to the shared s3 bucket configured by `shared_asset_bucket_name`.
You wouldn't generally run this manually, it'd be run automatically through
`cluster:create_and_publish_seed_file`.
