Create a cluster seed file

THIS IS DESTRUCTIVE. USE ONLY WHEN CERTAIN.

This creates a cluster seed file, which is a tarball that lets you
reproduce the state of a cluster in combination with other rake tasks. A
cluster seed file's purpose is primarily to let you create a consistent
testing environment.

A cluster seed contains:

* A database dump,
* A manifest of hostnames to allow the database to be modified correctly after
  loading, and
* The video and image files.

The process of creating a cluster seed involves downtime. It's not meant as a
backup process.

The cluster seed is stored in `$SHARED_STORAGE_ROOT/cluster_seed`.  After
creating the seed, you can use `cluster:publish_seed_file` to upload it
to shared s3 storage space.

`cluster:create_and_publish_seed_file` does both steps for you
automatically.
